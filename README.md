🧠 Algorithms & Data Structures – LeetCode Practice

This repository contains Data Structures and Algorithms implementations inspired by LeetCode problems, organized by algorithmic patterns and categories commonly used in coding interviews and competitive programming.

The goal is to build strong problem-solving skills by practicing pattern-based algorithms rather than random questions.
